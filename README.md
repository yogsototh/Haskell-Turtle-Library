# Turtle v1.2.1

Turtle is a reimplementation of the Unix command line environment in Haskell so
that you can use Haskell as a scripting language or a shell.  Think of `turtle`
as `coreutils` embedded within the Haskell language.

## Quick start

* Install [Stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack)

* `stack setup && stack install turtle`

Then fire up `ghci`:

```
$ stack ghci
Prelude> :set -XOverloadedStrings
Prelude> import Turtle
```

... and try out some basic filesystem operations:

```
Prelude Turtle> cd "/tmp"
Prelude Turtle> mkdir "test"
Prelude Turtle> touch "test/foo"
Prelude Turtle> testfile "test/foo"
True
Prelude Turtle> rm "test/foo"
Prelude Turtle> testfile "test/foo"
False
Prelude Turtle> rmdir "test"
Prelude Turtle> view (lstree "/usr/lib")
FilePath "/usr/lib/gnome-screensaver"
FilePath "/usr/lib/gnome-screensaver/gnome-screensaver-dialog"
FilePath "/usr/lib/libplist.so.1.1.8"
FilePath "/usr/lib/tracker"
FilePath "/usr/lib/tracker/tracker-miner-fs"
FilePath "/usr/lib/tracker/tracker-extract"
FilePath "/usr/lib/tracker/tracker-writeback"
FilePath "/usr/lib/tracker/tracker-search-bar"
FilePath "/usr/lib/tracker/tracker-store"
FilePath "/usr/lib/libgif.so.4.1"
...
```

To learn more, read the [turtle tutorial](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/turtle-1.2.1/docs/Turtle-Tutorial.html).

## Goals

The `turtle` library focuses on being a "better Bash" by providing a typed and
light-weight shell scripting experience embedded within the Haskell language.
If you have a large shell script that is difficult to maintain, consider
translating it to a "`turtle` script" (i.e. a Haskell script using the `turtle`
library).

Among typed languages, Haskell possesses a unique combination of features that
greatly assist scripting:

* Haskell has global type inference, so all type annotations are optional
* Haskell is functional and not object-oriented, so boilerplate is minimal
* Haskell can be type-checked and interpreted quickly (< 1 second startup time)

## Features

* *Batteries included:* Command an extended suite of predefined utilities

* *Interoperability:* You can still run external shell commands

* *Portability:* Works on Windows, OS X, and Linux

* *Exception safety:* Safely acquire and release resources 

* *Streaming:* Transform or fold command output in constant space

* *Patterns:* Use typed regular expressions that can parse structured values

* *Formatting:* Type-safe `printf`-style text formatting

* *Modern:* Supports `text` and `system-filepath`

## Development Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Gabriel439/Haskell-Turtle-Library.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Gabriel439/Haskell-Turtle-Library)

`turtle`'s types and idioms are reasonably complete and I don't expect there
to be significant changes to the library's core API.  The only major
functionality that I might add in the future would be to wrap
`optparse-applicative` in a simpler API.

The set of available tools currently covers as many filesystem utilities as I
could find across Hackage, but I would like to continue to add to the set of
available tools to minimally match `coreutils`.
